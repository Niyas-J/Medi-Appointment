## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Frontend loads but can't book appointments:**
- Backend not deployed yet → Deploy on Render
- REACT_APP_API_URL not set → Add in Vercel

**Backend sleeping (Render free tier):**
- First request takes ~30 seconds
- This is normal on free tier
- Upgrade to paid tier ($7/month) for always-on

**Email notifications not working:**
- Check EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASSWORD in Render
- Use Gmail App Password (not regular password)
- Check Render logs for errors
